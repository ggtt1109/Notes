		Safety analysis in work system of Hydropower-engineering is necessary to prevent undesired events that may cause catastrophic accidents. Fall from height is a one of the most common accidents in the construction of hydropower projects. It is important to transform the safety management from the "post processing type" to "predictive control type". This study provides a method to make statistical analysis of accidents based on Fault Tree and Bayesian Network.
